NAME
	starteventdetect - start Capturing audio and video when event an is trigged

SYNOPSIS
	starteventdetect [-d/-duration] [-fps] [-h/--height] [-w/--width] [-r/--rotation] [-cr/-cam_rotate]


DISCRIPTION

	starteventdetect is commnad that initialize GPIO pin 14 to detect high or low signal. If it recives high signal then it triggers Picamera to start video recording, Usb microphone to start audio recording and stepper motor to rotate.

	If no arguments passed then it will capture video for 2 minutes at 30 fps of height 480 and width 640 pixels, audio for 2 minutes and motor rotating about 300 degree. The output will be an h264 raw format video file, a converted MP4 file and a wav audio file with current date and time as its name on Desktop and an E-mail will be sent to specified email id with an image of current event captured by camera.

	In case of wrong arguments the default values will be taken.

OPTION

	-d,--duration
			Set video and audio duration in seconds to capture. default is 120 seconds.
	-fps
			Set frames per second of video. Default is 30.
	-h,--heigth
			Set video height in pixels. Default is 480.
	-w,--width
			Set video width in pixels. Default is 480.
	-r,--rotation
			Angle in degree to rotate the captured video. Default is 270.
	-cr,--cam_rotate
			Angle in degree to rotate motor about its axis. Default is 300.
